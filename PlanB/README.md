# Plan B

false-positive-speech-data implementation in python version of CS454, KAIST, 2019 Fall



## About the Plan B

Plan B is implemented in python and it covers most of functions in plan A. We planed genetic algorithm and we made a prediction as GA will take a lots of time. So we planned to implement with C/C++ to increase efficiency. However, the investigation found the benefits of using Python's library to make it much simpler. Therefore, we have attempted parallel development with Python in order to implement multiple functions more flexibly.
